## Do I need to learn programming for Alan?
Alan is *low* code, but not *no* code.

Alan looks like code, but it lives on a different level than what you normally think of as programming. Instead of using abstract logic, you create data models that describes aspects of a particular domain as you can observe it. Alan does know decisions (e.g. you can describe that a mountain bike has gears but a fixie doesn't), but you don't have to express that in abstract algorithms.

If you're not afraid of a deeply nested `IF` or a crafty `VLOOKUP` in Excel, Alan will definitely not scare you. In fact, I bet you'll find it lot of fun.

It has characteristics that make it really suited for something like a visual application builder, so who knows what the future brings here.

## Can I change how a property is visualized?
The generated user interface reads the annotations in an `application.alan` file to decide how to render a property. The Docs cover the possibilities in more detail, check the [model grammar](/pages/docs/model/89/application/grammar.html).

If you want more control over the user interface, e.g. to create one for a specific work flow, you may want to create a custom client. Documentation about this is being worked on.


## Can I limit permissions on certain properties?
Permissions are set on nodes, i.e. groups, entries and states. You can set read and update permissions to limit access to specific users, or users with a specific role.


## Can I create 2-way many-to-many relations?
If you want to simply get a list of everything that has a reference to a certain entry, you don’t have to model that explicitly. The client has a “usages” feature that automatically queries references in the opposite direction.

To make derivations and calculations based on this relation, you need to specify [bidirectional references](pages/docs/model/89/application/grammar.html#bidirectional-references).


## Can I write SQL queries?
Alan's datastore is not a relational database (it's graph-based) that you can query using SQL. Don't let that stop you though. Alan can interface with other databases, and you can create queries for Excel reports that you can download straight from the default user interface.

If you really need SQL, the datastore can expose a data stream that can be used to create an SQL mirror of the data in Alan's datastore.


## Can I connect to another system?
Alan datastore systems can talk to each other with interfaces. You can talk with relational databases using the Relational Database Bridge system.

More documentation will follow.

It is possible to connect to other systems using XML Schema or third party API's. This requires additional tooling that isn't available publicly. Please contact us for more information.


## What does that versions.json do?
You'll have noticed the versions.json at the root of your project. It defines a set of packages that should be compatible. Builds of version X are guaranteed to be based on the exact same language and configuration, but may contain bugfixes. We call these "major" versions.

The [project.pkg](/pages/tuts/bottom-up.html#project) also contains this versions list, to ensure that each next step uses the same major versions as your design.

Finally there is a "patch" level of versions (in semver-speak), for which we simply use incrementing build numbers. Alan's core tool chain guarantees that at this level compatibility cannot be broken, so it's always safe to use the latest builds.


## What is the roadmap for Alan?

Alan is already used by [M-industries](https://www.m-industries.com) and [Kjerner](https://www.kjerner.com/) to build solutions for their customers. However, we're not done yet improving the platform and creating new and better features.

Long term plans include:

- Open up our online development and hosting solution for quick experiments and proof of concept by any developer
- Extend the generated GUI so that there are even less reasons to go with a custom gui
- Make custom gui's (on the platform) easily extendible for third-party control & widget developers
- Make todo's the primary driver for the interaction with an application.
- Improved querying, reporting and data visualization features.
- Improved support for creating "live dashboard" applications.
- Making development more accessible to first-time application developers by providing a graphical modeler
- Providing a marketplace for applications, external connectors and gui controls & widgets
- Create more and more powerful legacy application logic imports
